# Raycraft
A simple minimalistic minecraft clone written in C++ with the raylib library! 
Just did this for personal learning, don't actually try to beat the enderdragon with this. (If you want to i can of course add one, just contact me on Discord: Rhys1xh)

Compiled with MSVC (Maximum Optimizations) for Win64 (PE 64-86x).
